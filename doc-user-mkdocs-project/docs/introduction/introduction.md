## Introduction ##

TSTool is a powerful software tool that automates time series processing and product generation.
It was originally developed for the State of Colorado to process data for river basin modeling and has since
been enhanced to work with many data sources including:

*   United States Geological Survey (USGS) web service and file formats
*   Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) web services
*   Regional Climate Center (RCC) Applied Climate Information Service (ACIS) web services
*   US Army Corps of Engineers DSS data files
*   others

TSTool is maintained by the Open Water Foundation,
which also enhances the software based on project needs.

*   See the [TSTool Download website](https://opencdss.state.co.us/tstool/) for the most recent software versions and documentation.
*   See the latest [TSTool Documentation](https://opencdss.state.co.us/tstool/latest/doc-user/) released by the State of Colorado to learn about core TSTool features.
*   See the [Bitbucket Plugin download page](https://software.openwaterfoundation.org/tstool-bitbucket-plugin/).

## TSTool use with Bitbucket Cloud Web Services ##

The [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) site hosts Git repositories.
This plugin lists Bitbucket projects, repositories, and repository data,
which allows automating workflows that process repository data.

See the following resources:

*   [Bitbucket Cloud Web Service API Documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/)

The [Bitbucket datastore documentation](../datastore-ref/Bitbucket/Bitbucket.md) describes how TSTool integrates with the API.
