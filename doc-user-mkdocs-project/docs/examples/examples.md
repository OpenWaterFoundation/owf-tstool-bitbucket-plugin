# TSTool / Examples of Use #

This chapter provides examples for using TSTool with Bitbucket.
See also the examples provided in TSTool documentation.

This documentation is incomplete and will be filled out as

-------------

## Quality Control Examples ##

TSTool can be used to implement automated quality control.

### Validating Software and Workflows ###

TSTool can be used to validate software and workflows.
It is always good to compare the results or two programs that are performing the same task,
and to validate a workflow with test data.
See the [TSTool Quality Control](https://opencdss.state.co.us/tstool/latest/doc-user/quality-control/quality-control/) documentation.
